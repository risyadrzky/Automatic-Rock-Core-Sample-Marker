As we know that marking the ore was conventionally carried out by using markers, this work to be sure requires a high level of accuracy and can take a long time. But can you imagine that there is a technology which can make this problem solved more efficiently in time?

This code provide image processing using unsupervised learning which mark the ore on the core sample fast and accurate.
